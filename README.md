# Parking Management System in Assembly Language

This is a Parking Management System implemented in Assembly Language (x86). The program simulates a simple parking management system where users can input their name and user ID, choose a vehicle type (rikshaw, car, or bus), view statistics, delete records, and exit the program.

## Prerequisites

- DOS emulator (e.g., DOSBox) to run the program
- Assembly compiler (e.g., NASM)

## How to Run

1. Use an assembly compiler (e.g., NASM) to assemble the code.
2. Run the compiled program using a DOS emulator (e.g., DOSBox).

## How to Use

1. When prompted, enter your name and user ID.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to choose vehicle types and perform actions.
3. View statistics and options such as total parked vehicles, amount collected, and more.

## Features

- User-friendly menu-driven interface.
- Supports parking of rikshaws, cars, and buses.
- Tracks and displays statistics like the total number of vehicles parked, total amount collected, and more.
- Allows users to delete all records, resetting the system.

## Note

Please note that this program is designed to be run in a DOS environment using an assembly compiler. The program may not run on modern systems without the use of emulators like DOSBox.
